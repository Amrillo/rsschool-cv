### About me: 

+ *Currently, I work as a financial analyst in a joint venture, with over 9 years of experience in the financial sector.

Recently, I successfully completed the "Aitilogy" course, where I acquired the necessary skills and knowledge in front-end development. During my studies, I developed several real interactive projects using JavaScript, TypeScript, and AngularJS. I am now actively seeking employment to apply my new knowledge and realize my potential in this new field. As part of the "Aitilogy" course, I independently created the following landing pages, websites, and SPA applications.*
